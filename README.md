# Python-Based-English-Dictionary
A simple English to English dictionary 

This simple python-based dictionary was written for a course I'm taking. Since I'm just a novice, I try to keep the dictionary app as simple as possible. It will be better not to use a Json dictionary file as I did in this project. Instead, using and connecting  a Mysql database which has the necessary Json file of the dictionary will be better. I'll try to improve this dictionary by adding some api capabilities and creating a Flask based Web application version.When I learn JAvascript, I'll make a better and more user friendly, interactive version of this dictionary.
